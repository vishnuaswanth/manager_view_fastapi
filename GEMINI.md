## Folder Structure Summary:

The project primarily consists of a `code/` directory containing Python files, likely for a FastAPI application. Key subdirectories within `code/` include:
- `api/`: Contains API-related files, including `dependencies.py` and `routers/` for different API endpoints (e.g., `allocation_router.py`, `forecast_router.py`, `manager_view_router.py`, `month_config_router.py`, `upload_router.py`).
- `logics/`: Contains business logic and utility files (e.g., `allocation_tracker.py`, `allocation.py`, `db.py`, `manager_view.py`, `core_utils.py`, `cache_utils.py`, `export_utils.py`, `month_config_utils.py`, `roster.py`, `summary_utils.py`, `types.py`). It also has a `config/` subdirectory with `forecast_grouping_rules.json` and a `data/constants/` subdirectory with Excel files.
- Main application files: `main.py`, `settings.py`, `cache.py`.

Other notable files and directories at the project root include various Markdown files (e.g., `ALLOCATION_DEBUG_GUIDE.md`, `api-spec.md`, `requirement.md`), a `.git/` directory, and a `tmp/` directory.
