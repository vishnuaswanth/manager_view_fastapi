## **Planning Phase:**

### Instructions
- I need you to create a plan, only description no code.
- It should be very concise, clear description of idea.
- I'll further ask clarrification if required.

### **Task:**
- I want to allocate unallocated resource to ForecastModel data through a trigger for a given month and year(report month).
- Current issue is choosing the right report to allocate and update the report from AllocationReportsModel Table data.
- Also I want to know what report can be used and what how can we allocate from the given report.
- Analyse and tell me what can be done, no code just flow chart or simple descriptions would be fine.
